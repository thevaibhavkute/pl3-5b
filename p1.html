        <h1>NASA’s ambitious Lucy mission has launched to explore Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids, pristine examples of the solar system’s early years.</h1>

            The mission timeline will see the Lucy mission taking a convoluted path through the inner solar system. After passing Donaldjohanson, named for the paleo-anthropologist who discovered the Lucy fossil, Lucy will go on to the Greek camp. First up is 3548 Eurybates and its moon in August 2027, 15094 Polymele in September 2027, 11351 Leucus in April 2028, and 21900 Orus in November 2028. <br>

Then, after an Earth flyby the day after Christmas 2030, Lucy will head for the camp of Trojans behind Jupiter in its orbit, reaching a large pair named 617 Patroclus-Menoetius on March 2, 2033. These final targets are on a high-inclination orbit around the Sun, making for a challenging approach. The team was fortunate that the timing works out to catch Patroclus as it passes through the ecliptic plane.
<br>
"Lucy embodies NASA's enduring quest to push out into the cosmos for the sake of exploration and science, to better understand the universe and our place within it," says NASA administrator Bill Nelson in a recent press release. "I can't wait to see what mysteries the mission uncovers!" <br>

            <b>WHY EXPLORE THE TROJANS</b> <br>
These asteroids have likely been trapped in their current orbits for billions of years. They thus represent pristine examples of material leftover from the formation of the solar system. Lucy will investigate the geology, composition, and interiors of the rocks to shed light on planet formation processes. Several of the asteroids targeted are C-type carbonaceous asteroids, and a few are suspected binaries or possess known moonlets.

           <strong>L’LORRI </strong> – This high-resolution imager will photograph the asteroids in visible light providing detailed maps of their surfaces. Built by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, it's a duplicate of the LORRI Long Range Reconnaissance Imager aboard New Horizons. <br>

            <strong>L’Ralph</strong> – Built at the Goddard Flight Center, this suite consists of a visible-light imager, , similar to the Ralph imager on New Horizons, and an infrared spectrometer. The duo will help determine the compositions of the asteroids' surfaces. <br>

            <strong>L’TES</strong>– This thermal-emission spectrometer, designed by Arizona State University, will examine the heat given off by asteroids, shedding light on their interior structures Also a spaceflight-proven technology, L'TES is similar to the OTES instrument aboard OSIRIS-REX.
